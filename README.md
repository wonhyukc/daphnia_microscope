# Daphnia, a.k.a waterplea, is wildly used to study  biotoxicity of water.

# It's unique swimming behavior is a good tool to quantify toxicity of water

# Inspired by FlyPi microscope of Dr. Andre Maria Chagas

# Before proceed, please have a good look of the original FlyPi paper

# We have added a USB microscope to watch Daphnia's swimming behavior

# Note three M4x100 bolts & nuts  are used to move X,Y,Z stage

# Watch how the bolt and nut are inserted to the 3D printed XYZ stage

# You need to 3D print a holder for the USB microsocpe

# The USB microsocpe can be purchased at AliExpress.com

# After 3D printing, put all the parts on a white paper

# Connect the USB microscope to your computer and run RoboRealm software
http://www.roborealm.com

# Study how they track the movement of tiny insects using RoboRealm
http://www.roborealm.com/tutorial/Blob_Tracking/index.php


# Select your USB microscope on RoboRealm's camera setup menu

# Run your the first image processing command - Auto Thresholding
